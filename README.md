# Titanic

Titanic is a machine learning model that predicts the survival of Titanic passengers based on certain features.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to save the data files (which can be found on Kaggle) to your Google Drive (the code was written in Google Colab) and edit the location in the file (where it is commented). When you run the file, you will be prompted to enter an authorization code (which will open up in another tab). Once you do this, you are done, and the file should run.

## Usage

Analyzing history through machine learning
